# Avian Carriers for IP Transfer

A simple landing page project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

The theme is "[IP over Avian Carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers)," a famous April Fools' Day joke for RFC 1149 from 2001.

> In computer networking, IP over Avian Carriers (IPoAC) is a proposal to carry Internet Protocol (IP) traffic by birds such as homing pigeons. IP over Avian Carriers was initially described in RFC 1149 issued by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), written by D. Waitzman, and released on April 1, 1990. It is one of several April Fools' Day Request for Comments.

The project aims to implement the fundamental HTML and CSS skills I have learned so far, especially Flexbox.

JavaScript and Gridbox are located farther away down the curriculum, so they weren't used here this time.
